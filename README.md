Part 1: 

Q1: Edge AI – Latency and Privacy

Explanation: Edge AI processes data locally on devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT sensors) rather than sending it to cloud servers. This drastically reduces latency (delay) since there is minimal or no communication with remote servers. It also enhances privacy because sensitive data doesn't leave the device.

Example: Autonomous drones use Edge AI to detect obstacles and make flight decisions in real time without relying on cloud connectivity. This enables quicker responses and keeps video/audio data local.



Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization

Comparison: Classical AI uses binary logic and deterministic algorithms. Quantum AI leverages quantum bits (qubits), superposition, and entanglement to perform computations in parallel, making it ideal for complex optimization problems.

Example Use Case: In logistics, quantum AI can optimize delivery routes faster than classical models. In finance, it can evaluate thousands of portfolio combinations in seconds.

Industries Benefiting Most:

Pharmaceuticals (drug discovery)

Finance (portfolio optimization)

Energy (grid optimization)



Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare

Impact: Human-AI collaboration transforms healthcare roles. Radiologists use AI for faster, more accurate scans. Nurses rely on AI to monitor vitals and alert them of critical changes. Instead of replacing jobs, AI augments human skills, improving decision-making and efficiency.

Example: AI-assisted diagnostic tools like IBM Watson help doctors diagnose rare diseases by analyzing vast medical records.



Case Study Critique: AI-IoT in Smart Cities

Benefits: Integrating AI with IoT enables smart traffic management. Real-time data from connected vehicles, sensors, and traffic cameras is analyzed by AI to reduce congestion, optimize traffic lights, and lower carbon emissions.

Challenges:

1. Data Security: IoT devices are prone to hacking.


2. Infrastructure Costs: Requires significant investment in smart infrastructure.

Task 3: Ethical Challenges in Personalized Medicine

Biases Identified:

Underrepresentation of minority groups in genomic datasets (e.g., TCGA)

Algorithmic bias can lead to unequal treatment recommendations.


Fairness Strategies:

Use ethnically diverse training data.

Conduct bias audits of AI models.

Engage bioethics experts in model development.
